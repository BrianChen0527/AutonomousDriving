# AutonomousDriving
Built a custom RC car with a webcam on top and raspberyPi inside.
Utilized tensorflow and OpenCV to construct an autonomous driving program that drives within lane lines and adjusts speed according to speed signs. 
Also used the CIFAR100 dataset to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that stops the car when it recognizes obstacles such as lego pedestrians on the road.
